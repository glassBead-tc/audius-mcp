# Cline Rules

## Operational Mode Patterns
1. All features must support both test and live modes
2. Test mode must:
   - Bypass SDK initialization completely
   - Use local test tracks only
   - Maintain full error handling
   - Provide equivalent user experience
3. Live mode must:
   - Handle SDK initialization gracefully
   - Provide proper error messages for SDK issues
   - Include fallback mechanisms

## Audio Player Implementation
1. Player must work consistently in both modes
2. Test tracks must:
   - Be royalty-free and properly attributed
   - Include basic metadata
   - Support all core playback features
3. Error handling must:
   - Provide user-friendly messages
   - Include fallback mechanisms
   - Log detailed errors for debugging

## Development Standards
1. All new features must:
   - Support both operational modes
   - Include comprehensive error handling
   - Maintain type safety
   - Update memory bank documentation
2. SDK integration must:
   - Handle initialization failures gracefully
   - Include proper error messages
   - Document requirements clearly
3. Documentation must:
   - Stay synchronized with implementation
   - Include clear next steps
   - Maintain accurate status
