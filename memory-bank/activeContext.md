# Active Context

## Current Task
Implementing Phase 3 (Financial & Blockchain) features for the Audius SDK MCP server.

## Current Status
Completed:
1. Core Music Experience (Phase 1)
   - All track functionality implemented
   - Full playlist management
   - Complete album handling
2. Social Layer (Phase 2)
   - User interactions complete
   - Comments and notifications implemented
   - Social discovery features added
3. Financial Features (Phase 3 - Partial)
   - Wallet integration complete
   - Track purchase system implemented
   - USDC transactions enabled

## Recent Changes
- Implemented pagination for trending tracks:
  - Created TrendingManager class
  - Added client-side pagination with configurable chunk size
  - Default limit of 10 tracks per request
  - Added offset support for pagination
  - Note: Implemented as client-side pagination since SDK doesn't support direct pagination
- Previous Changes:
  - Fixed server startup issues
  - Created .env.local with proper API credentials
  - Server now running successfully
  - Note: Punycode deprecation warning present but not affecting functionality

## Next Steps
1. Implement Analytics & Reporting:
   - Earnings tracking
   - Financial reporting
   - CSV export functionality
   - Transaction history views

## Important Notes
- Authentication Implementation:
  - Server uses API key/secret authentication (not OAuth)
  - OAuth implementation is intentionally left to clients
  - WalletManager handles wallet operations separately from auth
- Development Guidelines:
  - Maintain consistent error handling
  - Follow established patterns for new features
  - Keep comprehensive documentation
  - Ensure type safety
  - Test new endpoints thoroughly

## Current Challenges
- Track comment notification settings (SDK limitation)
- Analytics data aggregation
