# Product Context

## Purpose
This project aims to create a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that interfaces with the Audius SDK. Audius is a decentralized music streaming platform, and this MCP server will enable AI assistants to interact with the Audius platform programmatically.

## Problems Solved
- Enables AI assistants to interact with Audius platform features
- Provides a standardized interface for Audius SDK functionality
- Makes Audius platform capabilities accessible through MCP tools and resources

## Expected Functionality
The MCP server should:
1. Provide tools for interacting with Audius platform features
2. Handle authentication and authorization
3. Enable access to Audius music content and metadata
4. Support user interactions with the platform
5. Maintain proper error handling and response formatting

## Target Users
- AI assistants using the MCP protocol
- Developers building applications that need to interact with Audius
- Systems that need programmatic access to Audius platform features
